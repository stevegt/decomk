# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- The Go CLI entry point is `cmd/decomk`.
- Keep packages at module root or under purpose-named top-level directories (`contexts/`, `state/`, etc.); avoid `internal/` and `pkg/`.
- Keep planning artifacts in `TODO/` and maintain `TODO/TODO.md` sorted by priority.
- Do not commit local state files (for example `.grok`, `.grok.lock`) or generated binaries.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `go test ./...` runs the test suite.
- `go run ./cmd/decomk -h` prints CLI usage.
- `go run ./cmd/decomk plan ...` and `go run ./cmd/decomk run ...` exercise the core workflow.
- `gofmt -w .` (or `go fmt ./...`) formats Go code.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Keep Go code `gofmt`-clean; package names should be short and lower-case.
- Prefer focused edits over broad refactors unless required.
- Add and maintain explanatory comments for non-obvious logic.
- Use `git mv` for file moves/renames to preserve history.

## Comment Preservation Protocol (Required)
- Never remove existing code comments unless they are replaced in the same patch by equal-or-better explanatory comments near the same logic.
- When rewriting or refactoring code, port old explanatory intent first, then improve wording.
- If a touched non-trivial code block has no comments, add explanatory comments.
- Do not treat shorter comments as better unless they preserve all important intent.
- For any non-trivial behavior change, include a behavior-level comment with:
  - `Intent:` a short, clear rationale (a sentence or a few; no hard cap if more is needed for clarity).
  - `Source:` a DI ID in the format `DI-NNN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.
  - `NNN` is the TODO number of the TODO file where that DI entry resides.
  - Optional: TODO file/section reference for faster lookup.
- If a comment must be dropped with no replacement, stop and ask the user before proceeding.
- Before editing a file, review existing comments in that file.
- Maintain a `## Decision Intent Log` at the top of relevant `TODO/*.md` files.
- Treat DI logs as append-only history. Do not rewrite or delete prior entries.
- When intent evolves, add a new DI entry and set `Supersedes: <old-di-id>`.
- DI entries must include:
  - `ID: DI-NNN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
  - `Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
  - `Status: active|superseded`
  - `Decision:`
  - `Intent:`
  - `Constraints:`
  - `Affects:`
  - `Supersedes:` (optional)
- After editing, run a comment-delta audit on each touched code file using: `git diff -U0 -- <file> | rg -n '^-\\s*//|^-\\s*/\\*|^\\+\\s*//|^\\+\\s*/\\*'`.
- Resolve all removed-comment lines before finalizing unless explicit user approval was given.
- In the final response, include:
  - `Comment audit: PASS/FAIL`, with file list.
  - `Intent provenance audit: PASS/FAIL`, listing files with behavior changes and DI sources.
- Hard gate: behavior-changing work is incomplete unless comments preserve intent and include DI provenance.
- Do not remove comments or documentation; update them if outdated or incorrect.

### Comment + DI Examples
- Comment format example:
  - `// Intent: Keep context resolution stable across workspace scans to avoid target drift between plan and run. Source: DI-002-20260309-093000`
- Decision Intent Log entry template (for TODO files):
  - `ID: DI-NNN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
  - `Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
  - `Status: active`
  - `Decision: <what was decided>`
  - `Intent: <short clear rationale>`
  - `Constraints: <hard limits, dependencies, assumptions>`
  - `Affects: <paths, modules, commands, docs>`
  - `Supersedes: <old DI ID, optional>`

## Testing Guidelines
- Use Go's standard `testing` package with deterministic tests.
- Avoid network calls in tests unless explicitly required and documented.
- When changing `plan/run` behavior, add coverage for both command paths when possible.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Use short, imperative, capitalized commit subjects.
- Summarize changes per file in commit bodies.
- Stage files explicitly (avoid `git add .` / `git add -A`).
- PRs should include a concise summary, test commands run, and behavior notes for CLI output changes.

## Agent-Specific Notes
- Check `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` periodically for updated cross-repo guidance.
- Treat a line containing only `commit` as: add and commit all changes with an AGENTS-compliant message.
